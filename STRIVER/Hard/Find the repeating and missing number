Given an integer array nums of size n containing values from [1, n] and each value appears exactly once in the array, except for A, which appears twice and B which is missing.
Return the values A and B, as an array of size 2, where A appears in the 0-th index and B in the 1st index.
Note: You are not allowed to modify the original array.
Example 1
Input: nums = [3, 5, 4, 1, 1]
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation:
1 appears two times in the array and 2 is missing from nums
Example 2
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 5, 7]
Output: [7, 4]
Explanation:
7 appears two times in the array and 4 is missing from nums.

Constraints:-
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
n - 2 elements in nums appear exactly once and are valued between [1, n].
1 element in nums appears twice, and is valued between [1, n].

//code
class Solution {
    public int[] findMissingRepeatingNumbers(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] res = new int[2];
        int[] elements = new int[n+1];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            elements[nums[i]]++;
            if(elements[nums[i]]==2)
                res[0] = nums[i];
        }
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            if(elements[i]==0)
            {
                res[1] = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
