Given a sorted array of nums and an integer x, write a program to find the lower bound of x.
The lower bound algorithm finds the first and smallest index in a sorted array where the value at that index is greater than or equal to a given key i.e. x.
If no such index is found, return the size of the array.
Example 1
Input : nums= [1,2,2,3], x = 2
Output:1
Explanation:
Index 1 is the smallest index such that arr[1] >= x.
Example 2
Input : nums= [3,5,8,15,19], x = 9
Output: 3
Explanation:
Index 3 is the smallest index such that arr[3] >= x.

Constraints:-
  1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
  -10^5 < nums[i], x < 10^5
  nums is sorted in ascending order.

//code
class Solution {
    public int lowerBound(int[] nums, int x) {
        int low=0;
        int high = nums.length-1;
        int mid=(low+high)/2;
        while(low<=high)
        {
            mid =(low+high)/2;
            if(x==nums[mid])
            {
                return mid;
            }
            else if(x<nums[mid])
            {
                high = mid-1;
            }
            else
            {
                low = mid+1;
            }
        }
            return low;        
    }
}
