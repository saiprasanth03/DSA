Given a sorted array of nums consisting of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
Example 1
Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The target value 5 is found at index 2 in the sorted array. Hence, the function returns 2.
Example 2
Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: The target value 2 is not found in the array. However, it should be inserted at index 1 to maintain the sorted order of the array.

Constraints:-
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
-10^5<= target <= 10^5

//code
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.length - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;   // exact match
            } 
            else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } 
            else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        // low is the correct insert position
        return low;
    }
}
